Team portfolio (Farah, Eman, Marwa, Ahmad)

## Our Purpose:
**_"Function over form."_** _-Viktor_

We've created this portfolio page to test our ability to create fully accessible and responsive web pages.

## Our Website:
The webstie consists of four main sections, first is an accessible navbar, a portfolio of hypothetical assignments completed, overview of our team, and a form to contact the team.

## Completing the Project:
### _The Navbar, Headline and Footer_:
The **Navbar** consists of three main functional buttons, The portfolio button, the Team button, and the Contact button. Non-fixed navbar (javascript).

Each of the functional buttons identifies where to transfer the user by using the **id** of its corresponding section.

A **headline** that gives a brief intro. _image stored within the repository_

The **Footer** only contains credit.
